# ResistorCalculator
This should be a universal tool for all you calculation with resistors.

#Features

Currently it can calculate how much Ohm a resistor has.
You can calculate the Value from the color code, no matter if it has 4 or 5 rings.

#ToDo

- Clean up the code (found at least 2 subs, which i can merge into each other)
- Rename all the values. Currently you don't see whih datatyp a value has, i will change the name
- Inform about datatypes again. I'm pretty sure, that I took the wrong datatype for at least one value
- integrade a calculator to calculate which resistor you're needing for your circuit
- outputs the color code of the resistor you're needing.
